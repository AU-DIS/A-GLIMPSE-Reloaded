# A-GLIMPSE
Repository for the project **Is the Exp3 algorithm viable for online Knowledge Graph summarisation?**

**Abstract:**
The interest for Knowledge Graph summaries is growing, and methods such as a GLIMPSE now exist that can compute accurate static summaries. However, this is not effective for an online setting. We explore the viability of using the Exp3 algorithm for creating such summaries in an online setting. We create a modular framework that can perform various experiments with the Exp3 algorithm and compare it against GLIMPSE. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the Exp3 algorithm to determine under what conditions it yields sublinear regret. We find this sublinear regret on DBpedia Knowledge Graphs that meet these conditions. We further explore if Exp3 summaries on these subgraphs are accurate. We find that Exp3 summaries are not accurate for online settings, and we highlight potential causes of these results.
